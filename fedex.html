            <h2>FedEx&nbsp;Office Online&nbsp;Printing<h2>
            <h3>Analyzing usability and offering solutions</h3>

            <hr>
            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>Just because you can buy a perfectly functional color printer for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Printer-Wireless-enabled-F0V69A/dp/B013SKI4LU/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467586493&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=printer">$55 on Amazon</a> doesn’t mean we all have one at home. I don't have one in my tiny San Francisco studio apartment, so when I need to print something, I usually turn to a web service. For speed and geographic convenience, I have been using <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/">FedEx Office’s online printing</a><!--; there are three locations within a short walk of my apartment, and in my experience they tend to complete print jobs quickly and accurately once placed-->.</p>
            <p>Actually placing a print order using their sluggish Flash interface, though, is unpleasant at best. Every time I've tried to print a simple order, I’m shocked by how tedious the process is. I decided to run a small usability study to see if anyone else felt lost in the jungle of options the site forces on its users.<!-- I asked a few friends to run through the printing process from start to finish while I observed and took notes.--></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>GOALS AND PROCESS</h3>
            <p>In my own experience using the printing site, I noticed a couple recurring points of friction. In this study, my goal was to question whether the troublesome points I had noticed were in fact problematic for other users. I also wanted to see if participants could identify other obstacles that I hadn’t noticed. I hoped to identify the most notable pain points and propose remedial design solutions to smooth them over.</p>
            <!--<p>I found three participants for the study, all of whom were accustomed to using online services but had never used the FedEx Office site before. I provided each participant with a generic PDF file to print, and a copy of the study's instructions. The instructions were designed to provide a complete reference, covering all data inputs the user would have to make during the printing process. The process entailed uploading a document, choosing some print customizations, getting to the final checkout screen, and then going back and changing some of the customizations.</p>-->

            <p>I recruited and interviewed three participants, all of whom were accustomed to using online services, and gave them a simple task to complete. I observed as each participant progressed through the task<!--, encouraging them to think out loud and to voice any concerns they had. -->, and I recorded their screen and audio for data collection and reference.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>After the final interview, I reviewed the data I'd gathered and noted which elements of the process proved to be most challenging across all three participants. There were several spots that caused trip-ups during the interviews, but there were two specific design problems that seemed to hinder participants the most:</p>
            <h4>1. Simultaneous Display of "Print Color" and "Paper Selection"</h4>
            <p>After a user uploads a file to print, they are taken to a Print Options screen<!--that presents a huge range of customization options for the print job: collation, stapling, covers, paper type, documents per page, etc-->. I asked participants to customize the print color and paper type. When a user clicks either <strong>Print Color or Paper Selection</strong>, the options for both of those categories pop open, as shown here.</p>
            <img class="side-image-right" src="assets/toomanyoptions.gif" alt="Print Color and Paper Selection show up simultaneously no matter which you click">
            <p>This sudden barrage of options proved to be confusing for users.</p>
            <p class="quote">"When I click Print Color, I just wanna see the print color!"</p> <!--Another user was visibly perplexed, exclaiming, -->
            <p class="quote">"Wow, what is going on here? When you pick color, the paper options come up too, and that really bothers me."</p>
            <p>Participants wanted to deal with only one option at a time, instead of the current explosion of options that was forced on them. <!--It's easy to imagine a step-by-step process in which options for Print Color are offered, closed out, and then followed by an offering of options for Paper Selection.--></p>
            <h4>2. Cached Information Deletion After an Order Modification</h4>
            <img class="side-image-left" src="assets/addtocart.png" alt="Clicking Add to Cart after editing does not take you back to the checkout screen">
            <p><!--After a user finishes customizing their print order, they are asked to go through a series of screens to enter the following information: user location, pickup day, pickup location, pickup time, contact info, recipient info, and payment info. After entering that information and reaching the checkout screen, the user still has the option to go back and change the customizations on their order (e.g. choosing to print in color instead of grayscale). However, if they do decide to back and make that change, <strong>all of the above data fields are erased</strong>. This means that the user must re-enter all information about when and where they would like to pick up the order, including all contact and payment information.-->It's normal for users to want to modify information after they've entered it, and FedEx does allow you to go back and edit your cart from the final checkout screen. However, doing so erases all choices and information entered up to that point.</p>
            <p>In this study, participants were very surprised that after going back to make minor modifications, clicking "Add to Cart" did not whisk them back to the final checkout screen, but instead asked them to laboriously re-enter all of their information. Participants reacted quite strongly to this upsetting news.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Wait, now I have to do all of this again? That's not good."</p>
            <p class="quote">"They can’t just store your order form while you go back and make edits? I was ready to submit the payment and be done with it..."</p>
            <p>It seems like users are frustrated when they input information, only to have it forgotten moments later. One participant acknowledged that <!--people are sometimes anxious about entering all of their personal infomation, so forcing them to do it multiple times just because they edited something seems "silly" and --> it creates a "lack of confidence" in the site.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <h4>Present Fewer Options</h4>
            <img class="side-image-right" src="assets/improvedgif.gif" alt="">
            <p>The main problems users faced when choosing their print options was that they were presented with too many options at once, and clicking on one dropdown sometimes opened other dropdowns unexpectedly.</p>
            <p>Both of these annoyances can be addressed by a single solution: <strong>presenting fewer options at one time</strong>. More precisely, presenting only the dropdown for the category the user actually selects, and not extraneous options that the user may not have wanted to see. This way, the user will be shown choices that are more pertinent to their needs, and more in line with what they expect to happen.</p>
            <p>If a user selects Print Color, for example, we should only show them the ink color options, and not the options for paper type. Similarly, clicking on Paper Selection will open that dropdown by itself, without popping Print Color open as well. Finally, the surprising pop-up of the many paper types (i.e. Laser, Recycled, etc.) will only pop up if the user clicks on "General Use Papers," rather than opening automatically. This may risk a slight reduction in discoverability, but the tradeoff in not overwhelming the user is well worth it.</p>
            <h4>Cache User Data</h4>
            <p>Ideally, the user should be able to reach the checkout screen, go back and modify their order, then click "Add to Cart" and be whisked back to the final step in the process to submit their order. The user could feel free to go back and make changes, skipping the frustration of redundantly re-entering information.</p>
            <p>There are obvious use-cases where deletion of data is healthy for security reasons, but if a user wants to make a change to their order before they checkout, they shouldn't feel punished for doing so. By simply caching session data that has already submitted, including preferred FedEx location, print date/time, and contact/payment information, the user wouldn't be forced to go back through those screens multiple times.</p>
