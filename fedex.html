            <h3>Analyzing usability and offering solutions</h3>

            <hr>
            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>Just because you can buy a perfectly functional color printer for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Printer-Wireless-enabled-F0V69A/dp/B013SKI4LU/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467586493&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=printer">$55 on Amazon</a> doesn’t mean we all have one at home. My personal justification for not owning one is that it would take up too much room in my tiny San Francisco studio, with the only available surfaces being the top of the refrigerator and above the toilet tank. (But hey, if push comes to shove, I could make it work.) Suffice it to say that when I need to print something, I rely on a web service to have it done.</p>
            <p>There are tons of specialized services for printing t-shirts, flyers, brochures, photos, etc., but my printing needs tend to be the garden variety 8½ x 11 PDF. For speed and geographic convenience, I have been using <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/">FedEx Office’s online printing</a>; there are three locations within a short walk of my apartment, and in my experience they tend to complete print jobs quickly and accurately once placed.</p>
            <p>However, actually placing a print order using their sluggish Flash interface is nothing short of unpleasant. Every time I use it to print a simple, single-page print order, I’m shocked by how tedious the process is. For a site that has been <a href="http://online-printing-services-review.toptenreviews.com/fedex-office-review.html">praised</a> as “the best place to go online for printing standard business documents,” it seems over-complicated and completely unfriendly to someone looking for the simplest alternative to home printing.</p>
            <p>In light of the site’s generally positive reviews, I decided to run a small usability study to see if anyone else felt lost in the jungle of print options. I asked a few friends to run through the printing process from start to finish while I observed.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>GOALS AND PROCESS</h3>
            <p>In my own experience using the printing site, I noticed a couple recurring points of friction. In this general study, my goal was to question whether the troublesome points I had intended to target were in fact problematic for other users, and to see if participants could identify any obstacles that I hadn’t noticed.</p>
            <p>To conduct each study, I provided the participant with a generic PDF file to print and a copy of the instructions below. The instructions are meant to be a complete reference, covering all data inputs the user will have to make during the printing process. Although I was present for each run through of the study, I tried to make the instructions as thorough as necessary so that someone could walk through the steps independently.</p>
            <p>I sat and observed as each participant went through the steps of the printing process, encouraging them to think out loud and to voice any concerns they might have. I also recorded their screen and audio using Quicktime for future reference.</p>
            <p>One of the most frustrating things I found in my own experience is that the site will ask you to reenter a TON of information (pick up location, pick up time, all your contact info and credit card information) if you decide to alter any element of your order at the final checkout screen. To see how others felt about this, I waited until a participant was ready to submit their order and then asked them to go back and choose to print in color instead of black and white.</p>
