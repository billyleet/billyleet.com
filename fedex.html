            <h2>FedEx&nbsp;Office Online&nbsp;Printing<h2>
            <h3>Analyzing usability and offering solutions</h3>

            <hr>
            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>Just because you can buy a perfectly functional color printer for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Printer-Wireless-enabled-F0V69A/dp/B013SKI4LU/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467586493&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=printer">$55 on Amazon</a> doesn’t mean we all have one at home. I don't have one in my tiny San Francisco studio apartment, so when I need to print something, I usually turn to a web service. For speed and geographic convenience, I have been using <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/">FedEx Office’s online printing</a>; there are three locations within a short walk of my apartment, and in my experience they tend to complete print jobs quickly and accurately once placed.</p>
            <p>However, actually placing a print order using their sluggish Flash interface is nothing short of unpleasant. Every time I've used it to print a simple order, I’m shocked by how tedious the process is. I decided to run a small usability study to see if anyone else felt lost in the jungle of options the site forces on you. I asked a few friends to run through the printing process from start to finish while I observed and took notes.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>GOALS AND PROCESS</h3>
            <p>In my own experience using the printing site, I noticed a couple recurring points of friction. In this study, my goal was to question whether the troublesome points I had noticed were in fact problematic for other users, and to see if participants could perhaps identify other obstacles that I hadn’t noticed. By the end of the study, I hoped to identify the most notable pain points and propose remedial design solutions to smooth them over.</p>
            <p>I found three participants for the study, all of whom were accustomed to using online services but had never used the FedEx Office site before. I provided each participant with a generic PDF file to print, and a copy of the study's instructions. The instructions were designed to provide a complete reference, covering all data inputs the user would have to make during the printing process. The process entailed uploading a document, choosing some print customizations, getting to the final checkout screen, and then going back and changing some of the customizations.</p>
            <p>I sat and observed as each participant progressed through the task, encouraging them to think out loud and to voice any concerns or questions they might have. I also recorded their screen and audio for reference.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>After the final interview, I reviewed the data I'd gathered and noted which elements of the process proved to be most challening across all three participants. There were several spots that caused trip ups during the interviews, but there were two major design problems that elicited the strongest reaction from participants:</p>
            <h4>1. Simultaneous Display of "Print Color" and "Paper Selection"</h4>
            <p>After a user uploads a file they'd like to print, they are taken to a Print Options screen that presents a huge range of customization options for the print job: collation, stapling, covers, paper type, documents per page, etc. In this study, I asked participants to customize the job's print color and paper type. However, when a user clicks on either Print Color <strong>OR</strong> Paper Selection, the options for both of those categories pop open, as shown here.</p>
            <img class="side-image" src="assets/toomanyoptions.gif" alt="Print Color and Paper Selection show up simultaneously no matter which you click">
            <p>This sudden opening of this enormous swathe of options is confusing for users, who said they would prefer to deal with one option at a time. As one participant put it, "When I click Print Color, I just wanna see the print color!" Another user was visibly confused, exclaiming, "Wow, what is going on here? When you pick color, the paper options come up too, and that really bothers me."</p>
            <p>It seems like users like the participants in this study, who are making a handful of small changes to a document, would prefer to be presented only one option at a time. Instead of the current explosion of options all at once, it's easy to imagine a step-by-step process in which options for Print Color are offered, closed out, and then followed by an offering of options for Paper Selection.
            <h4>2. Cached Information Deletion After an Order Modification</h4>
            <p>After a site user finishes customizing their print order, they are asked to go through a series of screens to enter the following information: user location, pickup day, pickup location, pickup time, contact info, recipient info, and payment info. After entering that information and reaching the checkout screen, the user still has the option to go back and change the customizations on their order (e.g. choosing to print in color instead of grayscale). However, if they do decide to back and make that change, <strong>all of the above data fields are erased</strong>. This means that the user must re-enter all information about when and where they would like to pick up the order, including all contact and payment information.</p>
            <img class="side-image" src="assets/addtocart.png" alt="Clicking Add to Cart after editing does not take you back to the checkout screen">
            <p>In this study, participants were very surprised that after making minor modifications, clicking "Add to Cart" did not take them back to the final checkout screen, but instead asked them to re-enter all of their information. Every participant reacted strongly to this, saying things like, "Wait, now I have to do all of this again? That's not good," or "They can’t just temporarily store your order form while you go back and make edits? I was ready to submit the payment and be done with it."</p>
            <p>It seems like users are frustrated when they input information, only to have it forgotten moments later. One participant acknowledged that people are sometimes anxious about entering all of their personal infomation, so forcing them to do it multiple times just because they edited something seems "silly" and creates a "lack of confidence" in the site.</p>
            <p>There are obvious use-cases where planned deletion of data is healthy for safety purposes, but if a user wants to make a change to their order after editing the credit card information, they shouldn't have to feel punished for doing so. In fact, given the number of gracious promo codes offered by FedEx, it's likely that a user might decide to edit their order after seeing how cheap it can become with a promo code, which is also entered on the final checkout page.
