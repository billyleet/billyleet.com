            <h2>Designing a Syllable App<h2>
            <h3>Goals, Process, and Design</h3>

            <hr>
            <h3>WHY?</h3>
            <p>For children learning to read, segmenting a word into its syllables is an important part of the decoding process. A dauntingly long word to a 6 year old can become a lot less scary when broken up into smaller chunks. <!-- This is especially true for longer words that are hard to sight read.  --> Even as adults, we only have a passive awareness of syllables to help us break unknown new words into intelligible bits.</p>
            <p><!-- However, most native-speakers of any language don’t give much thought to syllables in spoken language; you have generally mastered the art of breaking your own language into bits, and do so subconsciously. -->For non-native speakers, particularly of English, it can be difficult to identify <strong>syllable boundaries</strong> or the places we choose to break up words into syllables. Learning to explicitly identify these boundaries can help non-native speakers improve their awareness of English sounds, and will lead to better listening and speaking skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Stress</strong> is also an important aspect of English pronunciation that is often not well understood by non-native speakers. <!-- (Think about the sentence “His <em>courage</em> makes him <em>courageous</em>.” The two forms of “courage” sound very distinct due to differences in stress.) --> Learning how to use stress properly in English can be the best way to improve pronunciation for an ESL speaker. Stress and syllables are intricately tied, and it’s necessary to first identify the syllables in a word before one can decide which syllable needs stress.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>GOAL</h3>
            <p>To teach syllable boundaries and stressed syllable identification. One skill feeds directly into the next.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>FEATURE OUTLINE</h3>
            <h4>1. Syllable Boundaries</h4>
            <p><strong>abracadabra → a-bra-ca-da-bra</strong></p>
            <p>The student will be shown an undivided word with at least two syllables, and will have to choose where to segment the word into its syllables.</p>
            <h4>2. Stressed Syllable Identification</h4>
            <p><strong>me-la-to-nin → me-la-TO-nin</strong></p>
            <p>The student will be shown a word that has already been segmented into syllables, and will have
            to choose the syllable that carries stress.</p>
            <h4>3. Two-in-One</h4>
            <p><strong>demonstrate → de-mon-strate → DE-mon-strate</strong></p>
            <p>This will be a combination of the previous two features: the student will be shown an undivided word, choose where to segment the word into its syllables, and then identify the syllable that carries stress.</p>
            <h4>4. Review</h4>
            <p>After each round, you will see your tally of how many answers you had correct, and you will have the opportunity to go back and review your missed words. You can also choose to play with only with your most-missed words, so you can practice the ones that need the most help.</p>
