            <h2>Q + A</h2>

            <h3>What makes you a good UXer?</h3>
            <p>I label myself as a professional listener. I'm empathetic and curious. I try to put myself in others' shoes, and see the world as they do. I take multiple perspectives into consideration, and act as a liaison between stakeholders who speak different languages (sometimes literally). I translate user wants and needs into data, and data into actions.</p>
            <p>I also just like to learn! I'm interested in so many different things and the people who do them. In the past year, I've been learning how to paint, bake, and code, plus learning languages so I can communicate better when I travel to a new place.</p>
            <h3>How does your history as a Speech-Language Pathologist support your current career?</h3>
            <p>My Masters degree is in Speech-Language Pathology, and there is a <strong>ton</strong> of overlap with UX research! Both fields are extremely data-driven and rely heavily on a thorough understanding of a client's needs before designing a solution.</p>
            <p>In both cases, you choose from a toolbox of methodologies to tailor your data to the problem at hand, gather contextual information to make a fully informed decision, and iterate your way through solutions (recognizing that "one size fits all" isn't an option) until you figure out what works. You manage multiple stakeholders who all want a say in what's best, and ultimately focus on the client.</p>
            <h3>Can you help with accessibility issues?</h3>
            <p>I can provide and help gather insight on a wide of communication-related issues, ultimately making products more universally accessible to people with disabilities. I can consult on and conduct studies with users who have communication differences like aphasia, deafness/hearing loss, autism spectrum disorders, brain injuries, and developmental disorders.</p>
            <p>I can also help with users from more well-represented populations, like ESL learners, senior groups, and people with accents. I also know ASL and used to work at a school for the deaf, so I have a particular interest in the area of hearing loss accessibility.</p>
