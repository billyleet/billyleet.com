            <h2>Personal History</h2>

            <h3>How does your career as a Speech-Language Pathologist support your UX skills?</h3>
            <p>My graduate degree is in Speech-Language Pathology, and there is a <strong>ton</strong> of overlap with UX! Both fields are focused on uncovering problems through data, and rely heavily on a thorough understanding of a client's needs before designing an empirically-based solution.</p>
            <p>In both cases, a practitioner chooses from a toolbox of methodologies to collect data relevant to the problem at hand, gathering context to make a fully informed decision. They then iterate their way through solutions (recognizing that "one size fits all" isn't an option) until they figure out what works. All the while, they manage multiple stakeholders who all want a say in what's best, and ultimately focus on the needs of the client.</p>

            <h3>Do you have experience with accessibility?</h3>
            <p>Yes! I can provide and help gather insight on a wide range of communication-related issues, ultimately making products more universally accessible. I can consult on and conduct studies with users who have communication differences like aphasia, deafness/hearing loss, autism spectrum disorders, brain injuries, and developmental disorders.</p>
            <p>I can also help with users from more well-represented populations, like ESL learners, senior groups, and people with accents. I also know ASL and have experience working with the Deaf population, so I have a particular interest in the area of hearing loss a11y.</p>
            <h3>How does all this make you a good UXer?</h3>
            <p>I label myself as a professional listener. I'm empathetic and curious, and I try to put myself in others' shoes to see the world as they do. I take multiple perspectives into consideration, and act as a liaison between stakeholders who speak different languages (figuratively or literally). I'm excited about translating user wants and needs into data, and data into solutions.</p>
            <p>I also just like to learn! I'm interested in so many different things and the people who do them. In the past year, I've been learning how to paint, bake, and code, all while learning new languages so I can continually improve communication.</p>
